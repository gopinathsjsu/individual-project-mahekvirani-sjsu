Read credit card records from a file, validate the card number, determine the card issuer (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), and create instances of the corresponding credit card class.
Implement a CreditCardFactory class with a method createCreditCard that takes the credit card number and other details as parameters. This method will determine the type of credit card and instantiate the appropriate subclass.
This app uses three special techniques: one for going through data efficiently, one for picking the best way to do things, and one for making new credit card instances for each correct credit card types easily.
